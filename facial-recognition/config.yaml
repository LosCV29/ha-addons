  # Hardware preset - overrides model and detector if set
  # auto: Select best settings for your hardware automatically
  # lightweight: Fast, low RAM (~300MB) - good for Raspberry Pi
  # balanced: Good balance of speed and accuracy (~1GB RAM)
  # accuracy: Best accuracy, higher resources (~1.5GB+ RAM)
  # custom: Use manual model_name and detector_backend settings
  hardware_preset: "balanced"

  # Manual model selection (only used when hardware_preset is "custom")
  # Models ordered by accuracy (best to worst):
  # - ArcFace: State-of-the-art accuracy, ~1.5GB RAM, medium speed
  # - Facenet512: Excellent accuracy, ~1.2GB RAM, medium speed
  # - VGG-Face: Very good accuracy, ~2.5GB RAM, slower
  # - Facenet: Good accuracy, ~500MB RAM, fast
  # - SFace: Good accuracy, ~300MB RAM, fastest
